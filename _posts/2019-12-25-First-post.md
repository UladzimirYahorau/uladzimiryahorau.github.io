> In his book James Clear describes a structured and clear way to build good habits and break bad ones. This post is my summary of the ideas described in this book.

Authors observes that there is a _general pattern_ about habits: We get a *cue* from our environment which triggers a *craving* to do something. Then our *response* follows and , finally, we receive a reward. 

Based on this observation, the method is proposed to build new good habits while breaking bad ones. 

Indeed, what we are dealing with is the loop cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> ...

What if we want to build a new habit. We want something to trigger it, we want to make it obvious (creating of the right cues part!).
Then once we remembered about it would be great to start wanting to proceed with actions of doing the habit. For this it would be great if we can make it attractive (the creaving part of the above loop).
Now, once we feel like we want to do it at the moment, it is important to make it easy for us to start with doing it (taking care of the response part of the loop).
Finally, in order for us to want to repeat this habit again, we want to feel satisfied at the end after finishing the actions, i.e., we want the "reward" to be positive.

Now, what about breaking bad habits. The idea is based on the same general observation about the habits: while during habit building procedure we try to make habit loop as smooth as possible, as easy to enter as possible, here we want to make it hard for us to enter the bad habit loop. In other words, we eliminate cues triggering bad habits from our environment, we find a way to make those habits unattractive (so that we do not crave doing them), we make them uneasy to perform, which prevents us from falling into them through impulsive reactions. Finally, we make them unsatisfying.

In what follows we discuss in greater details of how to make all these work.
