> In his book James Clear describes a structured and clear way to build good habits and break bad ones. This post is my summary of the ideas described in this book.

- **atomic** 
    - an extremely small amount of things; the single irreducible unit of a larger system. 
    - the source of immense energy and power. 
- **habit** 
    - a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation.

## Introduction

Authors observes that there is a **general pattern** about habits: We get a **cue** from our environment which triggers a **craving** to do something; in turn, our **response** follows and , finally, we receive a **reward**. 

Based on this observation, the method is proposed to build new good habits while breaking bad ones. 

Fundamentally, what we are dealing with is the loop 
     
     cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> ...

What if we want to **build a new habit**:
- We want something to **trigger** it, we want to **make it obvious** (creating of the right cues part!).
- Once we remembered about it, it would be great to start wanting to proceed with actions of doing the habit. For this we **make it attractive** (the craving part of the above loop).
- Now, once we feel like we want to do it at the moment, it is important to **make it easy** for us to start with doing it (taking care of the response part of the loop).
- Finally, in order for us to want to repeat this habit again, we want to **feel satisfied** after finishing the actions, i.e., we want the "reward" to be positive.

Now, what about **breaking bad habits**. The idea is based on the same general observation about the habits: while during habit building procedure we try to make habit loop as smooth as possible, as easy to enter as possible, here we want to make it hard for us to enter the bad habit loop. In other words:
- we **eliminate cues** triggering bad habits from our environment
- we find a way to **make those habits unattractive** (so that we do not crave doing them)
- we **make them uneasy** to perform, which prevents us from falling into them through impulsive reactions
- we **make them unsatisfying**.

In what follows we discuss in greater details of how to make all these work.

## Building a new habit
### Make it obvious 
### Make it attractive
### Make it easy
### Make it satisying

## Breaking bad a bad habit
### Hide the cues for it 
### Make it unattractive
### Make it hard to start
### Make it unsatisfying
