> In his book Atomic Habits James Clear describes a structured and clear way to build good habits and break bad ones. This post is my summary of the ideas described in this book.

- **atomic**
    - an extremely small amount of things; the single irreducible unit of a larger system.
    - the source of immense energy and power.
- **habit**
    - a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation.

## Introduction

Authors observes that there is a **general pattern** about habits: We get a **cue** from our environment which triggers a **craving** to do something; in turn, our **response** follows and , finally, we receive a **reward**.

Based on this observation, the method is proposed to build new good habits while breaking bad ones.

Fundamentally, what we are dealing with is the loop

     cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> cue -> craving -> response -> reward -> ...

What if we want to **build a new habit**:
- We want something to **trigger** it, we want to **make it obvious** (creating of the right cues part!).
- Once we remembered about it, it would be great to start wanting to proceed with actions of doing the habit. For this we **make it attractive** (the craving part of the above loop).
- Now, once we feel like we want to do it at the moment, it is important to **make it easy** for us to start with doing it (taking care of the response part of the loop).
- Finally, in order for us to want to repeat this habit again, we want to **feel satisfied** after finishing the actions, i.e., we want the "reward" to be positive.

Now, what about **breaking bad habits**. The idea is based on the same general observation about the habits: while during habit building procedure we try to make habit loop as smooth as possible, as easy to enter as possible, here we want to make it hard for us to enter the bad habit loop. In other words:
- we **eliminate cues** triggering bad habits from our environment
- we find a way to **make those habits unattractive** (so that we do not crave doing them)
- we **make them uneasy** to perform, which prevents us from falling into them through impulsive reactions
- we **make them unsatisfying**.

In what follows we discuss in greater details of how to make all these work.

## Building a new habit

### Make it obvious
When we are building a new habit it is important that we get reminders which trigger the habit. It is important for us to make it easy to return back to the habit. James suggests the following techniques:
- Write down your current habits to become aware of them. The idea is that in order to improve something we first have to become aware of it.
- Use implementation intentions: "I will {behaviour} at {time} and {location}".
    Example:
    - I will go to gym at 5:30pm and in my building.
- Use habit stacking: After {current habit}, I will {new habit}.
    Example:
    - After doing morning exercises, I will meditate for 10 minutes.
- Design your environment in such a way that cues of good habits are obvious and visible.
    Example:
    - Have your running shoes ready near the entrance door of your apartment.
    - Have a book you are reading on your table.

### Make it attractive
- Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
    Example:
    - Listen to your favourite podcast while doing the dishes.
- Join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour.
    Example:
    - If you started running recently, join your local running club.
    - If you are learning data science join your local Data Science meetup.
    - If you want to eat healthy hanng out with people who already it healthy.
- Create a motivational ritual. Do something you enjoy before the difficult habit.

### Make it easy
- Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habit.
    Example:
    - Have your running shoes ready so that when you come from work you can put them on and go running right away.
    - Have your healthy grains (oats, buckwheat) ready in the same place in the kitchen so that it is easy to go and cook them.
- Prime your environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easy.
- Pay attention to decisive moments. Those are like forks during the course of your day.
- Use the Two-minute Rule.
- Automate your habits. Invest in technology and 1-time purchases that lock future behaviour.

### Make it satisfying
This part is crucial, since it takes care of us wanting to repeat this behaviour in the future.
What is immediately awarded is repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided.
- Use reinforcement learning. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete the habit. Incentives can start a habit, identity sustains it. It takes time for the new identity to emerge.
- Make "doing nothing" enjoyable. When avoiding bad habits, design a way to see benefits.
- Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit chain and do not break it.
- Never miss twice. Make sure that if you missed a habit, you return on track immediately.

## Breaking a bad habit

### Hide the cues for it
- Reduce exposure. Hide the cues of bad habits from your environment.
    Example:
    - do not check your Facebook profile during weekdays; do not buy junk food.  

### Make it unattractive
- Reframe your mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habit.

### Make it hard to start
- Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.

### Make it unsatisfying
- Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behaviour.
